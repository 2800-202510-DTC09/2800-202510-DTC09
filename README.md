# SustainMe

Modern lifestyles often leave people unaware of how their daily habits contribute to environmental issues like carbon emissions, water waste, or electricity overuse. SustainMe is a personalized environment tracker web app that helps users visualize and understand the environmental impact of their everyday decisions and helps them make improvements to their habits. The app uses achievements and badges, like a game, to make the process fun.
